###  Employeeâ€™s Overview
***I am an EPAM financial analyst*** on a maternity leave and I am ***a super-loyal employee*** who loves being a part of EPAM's community. I had worked as an economist for 5+ years, when I took a web development course and fell in love with programming. I am a really ***hard-working*** and ***result-oriented*** person. I never stop ***improving my skills***. I am both good at being a ***team-player and working individually***. I have ***worked in many different sectors*** including manufacturing, construction, retail and IT, so I am certain I can make a valuable addition to any project I am involved in. I have a nice sense of humor, love reading, solving puzzles and drawing illustrations.
